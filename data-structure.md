# List of Data Structures

### Primitive types
- Boolean -> (true or false)
- Character
- Floating-point numbers, limited precision approximations of real number values.
    - Including Single precision and Double precision IEEE 754 Floats, among others
- Fixed-point numbers
- Integer, integral or fixed-precision values.
- Reference (also called a pointer or handle), a small value referring to another object's address in memory, possibly a much larger one.
- Enumerated type, a small set of uniquely named values.

### Composite types or non-primitive type
- Array (as an example String which is an array of characters)
- Record (also called tuple or structure)
- Union (Tagged union is a subset, also called variant, variant record, discriminated union, or disjoint union)

### Abstract data types
- Container
- List
- Tuple
- Multimap (example Associative array)
- Set
- Multiset (bag)
- Stack
- Queue (example Priority queue)
- Double-ended queue
- Graph (example Tree, Heap)
